# EthSLR

EthSLR is a python implementation that aimed to determine the outperforming Recurrent Neural Network
to recognize Ethiopian Sign Language. The implementation includes reading stored data and splitting it
to a training and testing data portions. The hyperparameters for each networks are searched using KerasTuner
in such a way that validation accuracy in maximized. The optimal hyperparameters are then used to train 
the networks. Learning curves for each training are the visualized.
